// 1. useReducer()
// The useReducer(reducer, initialState) hook accepts 2 arguments: the reducer function and the initial state.
// The hook then returns an array of 2 items: the current state and the dispatch function.

// A. Initial state
// The initial state is the value the state is initialized with.

// B. Action object
// An action object is an object that describes how to update the state.
// Typically, the action object has a property type â€” a string describing what kind of state update the reducer
// must do.

//C. Dispatch function
// The dispatch is a special function that dispatches an action object.
// Whenever you want to update the state (usually from an event handler or after completing a fetch request),
// you simply call the dispatch function with the appropriate action object: dispatch(actionObject).
// In simpler terms, dispatching means a request to update the state.

//D. Reducer function
// The reducer is a pure function that accepts 2 parameters: the current state and an action object.
// Depending on the action object, the reducer function must update the state in an immutable manner, and
// return the new state.
//The reducer above doesn't modify directly the current state in the state variable, but rather creates a new
// state object stored in newState, then returns it.
